\begin{abstract}
A report to outline validation of C\'el\'erit\'e. We compare the tools used to fitting for $\tau$ and $SF_{\infty}$ to those of 
\cite{kozlowski2017a}and \cite{macleod2011}. To do so we reproduce some of experiments they conducted, and evaluate whether they can be mutually consistent.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:1}

Quasars exhibit stochastic variability with characteristic timescales of hundreds of days (Kelly+2009,  Kozlowski+2010,2016, 2017 Macleod+2010,2011,2012, Zu+2011,2013,2016, Kasliwal+2015,2017 ). We employ  C\'el\'erit\'e \citep{foreman2017} , which allows to express any one -dimensional process as a Gaussian Process.  Gaussian Process is defined by covariance and mean. Covariance parameters are often called hyperparameters. To find best-fit hyperparameters we optimize the marginal likelihood  (eq. 5.4, 5.8, Rassmussen\&Williams book). Since the marginal likelihood is the integral of  the product of likelihood and prior,  the logarithm of marginalized likelihood is the sum of the log-likelihood and log-prior (eq.2.28 Rassmussen\&Williams). 

In this report we summarize the tests that have been made to establish great usefulness of  C\'el\'erit\'e in modelling the DRW light curves as Gaussian Processes. We  first compare whether algorithms used to make mock DRW light curves are identical between MacLeod +2011 (which we use), and \cite{kozlowski2017a} (who challenges Macleod+2011 results, and whose results we reproduce). Then we describe how  a choice of boundaries and priors affects the results of best-fit hyperparameters with  C\'el\'erit\'e. [[ We then compare C\'el\'erit\'e  to another well-tested tool (used by \cite{kozlowski2016a}, \cite{zu2011}, etc.) - JAVELIN ]].  We then reproduce results of \cite{macleod2011} Fig.15, and \cite{kozlowski2017a} Fig.2 .  	We aim to answer the following questions: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item are the tools for fitting tau and SFinf equivalent?
\item can we reproduce Chelsea`s Fig 15?
\item can we reproduce Kozlowski`s plot? 
\item are their plots mutually consistent, given our analysis? 
\item can we reproduce best-fit tau and SFinf obtained using light curve
     fitting with the SF approach? 
\end{enumerate}




\section{Simulating DRW}
\label{sec:simDRW}

We simulate damped random walk light curves by drawing  points from a Gaussian distribution, for which mean and standard deviation are re-calculated at each timestep. Given an input of observation times $t$,   $SF_{\infty}$ - the asymptotic value of the structure function, mean magnitude  $\langle y \rangle$, and the damping timescale $\tau$, we start at time $t_{0}$ and signal at that time is equal to the mean$y_{0} = \langle y \rangle$. The timestep is   
$\Delta t_{i} = t_{i+1} - t_{i}$.  Given  the signal at time $t_{i}$: $y_{i}$,  and $\Delta t_{i}$,  the signal at next time step $y_{i+1}$ is drawn from  $\mathcal{N}(loc, stdev)$, where : 

\begin{equation}
loc = y_{i} e ^ { - r  }  + \langle y \rangle \left( 1 - e ^{ - r }\right)
\end{equation}

and 

\begin{equation}
stdev^{2} =  0.5  \, \mathrm{SF}_{\infty}^{2} \left( 1 - e ^{  - 2 r  }  \right)
\end{equation}

with  $r = \Delta t_{i} / \tau$.   Here we followed eq. A4 and A5 in \cite{kelly2009}, as well as Sec. 2.2 in \cite{macleod2010}.  To this ideal light curve signal we add photometric noise $\mathcal{N}(0,n_{i})$, where $n_{i}$ is the observational photometric noise.  It is equivalent to  Kozlowski+2017 formulation , who also starts with the signal $s_{i}$ , drawing at each time step light curve points from  a Gaussian distribution with dispersion  $stdev$ and mean $loc$, subsequently adding the mean $\langle y \rangle$ and Gaussian noise (see Eq. (2) of \cite{kozlowski2017a}).


Apart from $\tau$ and $SF_{\infty}$, we choose $N_{pts}$ - at how many points to sample the simulated DRW process, and the length of baseline $T = l \cdot \tau$.  In this formalism the baseline multiplicity $l$  is equivalent to $1 / \rho$ where  $\rho = \tau / T $  (Kozlowski+2017). We can sample the baseline either at regular intervals of $\Delta t$, or at random $N_{pts}$. One sets the other - given  $\Delta t$,  we find $N_{pts}$ as the nearest integer to $t_{max} - t_{min} / \Delta t $. 


\section{DRW as Gaussian Process}
DRW is a stochastic process defined by the covariance matrix  

\begin{equation}
S_{ij} = \sigma^{2} \exp{ \left(   -  \Delta t_{ij} / \tau \right)}
\end{equation}
( see Kozlowski+2010 eq. 1, Kozlowski+2017 eq. 1,  MacLeod+2011 eq.1, Zu+2013 eq. 3 , etc ).  A scatter of magnitude difference plotted as a function of time lag $\Delta t_{ij} $ is called the Structure Function (SF).  SF for the Damped Random Walk is described by  :

\begin{equation}
SF(\Delta t_{ij} ) = SF_{\infty} \left( 1 - e^{-|\Delta t_{ij} /\tau|} \right) ^{1/2}
\end{equation}

For large $\Delta t_{ij} $ , we have    
\[ \lim_{\Delta t_{ij} \gg \tau} e^{-|\Delta t_{ij} /\tau| }= 1 \]
so that: \[   SF(\Delta t_{ij} \to \infty)\xrightarrow[]{} SF_{\infty} \].  Following MacLeod+2011,  we define the driving amplitude for shot-term variability as :

\begin{equation}
\hat{\sigma} = \sigma \sqrt{2 / \tau}
\end{equation} 

We can relate $SF_{\infty}$ to $\sigma$ and $\hat{\sigma}$ : 

\begin{equation}
SF_{\infty} = \hat{\sigma} \sqrt{\tau} = \sigma \sqrt{2}
\end{equation} 

thus $SF_{\infty}$ is just a scaled version of $\sigma$. 

Another often used combination of hyperparameters is called $K$ (as in MacLeod+2011) : 

\begin{equation}
K = \tau \sqrt{SF_{\infty} }= \tau \sqrt{\sigma} 2^{1/4} 
\end{equation}.  

In the $\log{\sigma}$ - $\log{\tau}$ space, lines of constant $K$ or $\hat{\sigma}$ are perpendicular to each other.  This is because, if we take $\log{\hat{\sigma}}$, and rearrange, we have  : 

\begin{equation}
\log{\sigma} = \frac{1}{2} \log{\tau} + \log{\hat{\sigma}} - \frac{1}{2} \log{2}
\label{eq:sigma_hat_line}
\end{equation}

and from  $\log{K}$ : 

\begin{equation}
\log{\sigma} = -2 \log{\tau} + \log{K} - \frac{1}{2} \log{2}
\label{eq:K_line}
\end{equation}

These equations denote lines $y = ax + b$,  and the slope of one is the  inverse reciprocal of another, which proves that they are orthogonal in that space (see Fig.~\ref{fig:lc_logL_arrows})

Covariance matrix, or kernel, is a function that defines similarity between two points. In general, a kernel is any function that maps $x$, $x'$ onto $\mathbb{R}$. Thus a covariance function is a specific type of a kernel.   A Gaussian process is defined by its covariance function and mean. To model light curves as DRW using Gaussian Process approach we use the Real Term kernel in Celerite : 

\begin{equation}
S_{ij} = a_{j} e^ {-c_{j} | t_{j} - t_{i}|}
\end{equation}

with parameters  \verb|log_a| and \verb|log_c|.    It is clear that this is a DRW kernel if we substitute  $a_{j} \equiv \sigma^{2}$, and  $c_{j} \equiv \tau^{-1}$, so that $\verb|log_a| = 2 \log \sigma$, and $\verb|log_c| = - \log \tau$.  By default there are no boundaries on parameter values, and there is no prior.  We find that imposing very liberal boundaries does not affect the result of fit but helps ensure computational stability. Thus we choose to limit $\sigma$ to between 0.01 and 1.0 mag, and $\tau$ to between 1 and 10000 days . 
Both \cite{macleod2011}  and \cite{kozlowski2017a} use Jeffreys prior \citep{jeffreys46} on $\tau$ and $\hat{\sigma}$ : $prior(\tau) = 1 / \tau$ ,  and $prior(\hat{\sigma}) = 1 / \hat{\sigma}$.  Jeffreys prior  can be effectively expressed in terms of  \verb|a| and \verb|c| parameters :  

\begin{equation}
prior(\verb|a|,\verb|c|) = c + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 ac}} 
\end{equation}

so that in logarithmic space : 

\begin{equation}
\log{(prior)} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \verb|log_c| - \verb|log_a|- \log{2} \right)
\end{equation}


\section{Likelihood for GP}
Celerite efficiently evaluates the marginalized likelihood of the dataset under a Gaussian Process model with given kernel and hyperparameters. We optimize the  log-likelihood  for the best-fit hyperparameters with the stable   L-BFGS-B  \citep{lu1995}, \citep{zhu1997}  algorithm   using  \verb|scipy.optimize.minimize| \citep{jones2001} implementation.  We illustrate the shape of log-likelihood for a simulated light curve with parametes  {$\tau_{in}=100$ days, $\sigma_{in} = 0.2^{\mathrm{mag}}$, Gaussian noise of $0.001^{\mathrm{mag}}$, with length $20 \tau$, and regular sampling of $\Delta t = 1 $ day  }, and flat prior . See   Fig. ~\ref{fig:lc_logL_fit}  for the light curve and GP prediction, and Fig.~\ref{fig:lc_logL} for the the shape of log-likelihood evaluated for this data on the grid of hyperparameters $\sigma$, $\tau$.

% or how we reproduced Macleod+2011 Fig. 15  : 
% Celerite_fit_simulated_data.ipynb 

% the simulation setup  : the knobs and whistles 
We simulate  light curves as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:simDRW}, using the same input parameters as \cite{macleod2011} : $\tau_{in} = 575 $ days, $SF_{\infty}= 0.2 $ mag, regular sampling interval of 10 days ,  $\sigma = SF_{\infty} / \sqrt{2} = 0.1414 $.  We start with 10 000 realizations of a very long (40 years)  and well-sampled  ($\Delta t = 10 days$) light curve.  We fit with Celerite , using bounds on $\sigma$ : [0.1 - 1.0] mag,  and bounds on $\tau$ : [1 - 10000 ] days. At each realization,  we select 1- , 3-, 10- year , full sections of the light curve. We fit at each light curve section length with   with both flat prior or Jeffrey's prior. 

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1.05\columnwidth]{figs/DRW_Chelsea_multiyears_log_prior.png}
\caption{Sections of the 40-year light curve, fitted with the Jeffreys (log) prior. These sections are used to reproduce experiment from \citep{macleod2011}.  From top to bottom: 40-year, 10-year, 3-year, 1-year sections. The input is $\tau = 575$ days, $SF_{\infty} = 0.2$, so that $\sigma = 0.14$, homoscedastic error of 0.001 mag.  }
\label{fig:lc_sections}
\end{figure}


% the original figure  : how we have the same behavior 

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1.05\columnwidth]{figs/MacLeod_2011_Fig_15_flat.png}
\caption{Distribution of results of 10000 iterations of DRW light curve , at each iteration fitting the full light curve, or its 1,3, or 10 year sections, shown with dotted, thick solid,  dashed, or thin solid lines, respectively. From top left panel, going clockwise, we display the ratio of each quantity derived from fitted $\tau$, $\sigma$ to the input values:  $\hat{\sigma}  = SF_{\infty}  / \sqrt{\tau}$,  $K = \tau \sqrt{SF_{\infty}}$, $SF_{\infty} = \sqrt{2} \sigma$, and $\tau$. We display the rms and bias calculated for each distribution ($rms \equiv  \sqrt{\langle x^{2}\rangle}$, $bias \equiv \langle x \rangle $, with the latter being the distribution mean). Note that, especially as seen on upper right and bottom panels, the longer the section of the light curve that we use, the smaller the bias. It is surprising that even for a well-sampled 40-year light curve the bias in all four quantities is nonzero, but the overall conclusions : that the result of DRW fit asymptotically converge to true values only for light curves much longer than $10 \tau$,  are similar to those of \citep{macleod2011}. }
\label{fig:macleod11_15}
\end{figure}


% two additional experiments : 

We also performed two controlled experiments : how changing the number of points, or changing the baseline, affects the results.  

% 1)  changing the number of points  : weird stuff happens  : 
     % inspecting the Structure Function .... 
With the former, we keep the light curve  baseline fixed at 40 years,  initially sampled by 1460 points ( that corresponds to the regular interval of 10 days : $40 * 365 / 10  = 1460$) - this is the same starting light curve as in the top panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:lc_sections}. 
We then increase the number of points by a factor $f \in {1,2,4,8}$. We illustrate that for flat prior on Fig.~\ref{fig:Npts_experiment}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1.05\columnwidth]{figs/DRW_Chelsea_Npts_test_flat_prior.png}
\caption{Experiment increasing the sampling density of the fixed baseline light curve. From top to bottom, we increase the initial number of points sampling the underlying process from 1460 to twice, four, and eight times more : second, third and fourth panels, respectively. }
\label{fig:Npts_experiment}
\end{figure}


We plot an equivalent measure as Fig.\ref{fig:macleod11_15}, detailing the results of this experiment - see Fig.~\ref{fig:macleod11_15_Npts}

\includegraphics[width=1.05\columnwidth]{figs/MacLeod_2011_Fig_15_N_pts_test_flat_prior.png}
\caption{Distribution of Celerite fit results of 1000 iterations of DRW light curve simulations in controlled number of points experiment. At  each iteration we make a realization of DRW light curve with input $\tau=575$ days, $SF_{\infty}=0.2$ mag, 40 -year baseline, sampled at regular intervals by $f \cdot 1460 $ points,  where $f \in {1,2,4,8}$.}
\label{fig:macleod11_15_Npts}
\end{figure}


% 2) changing the baseline : exactly as expected 
We also performed an experiment keeping the number of points per light curve fixed at N = 1460 , but extending the baseline by factor $f \in {1,2,4,8}$. All other parameters are as before ( $\tau = 575$ days, $SF_{\infty} = 0.2$ mag, $err = 0.001$ mag). We illustrate the light curves used on Fig.~\ref{fig:lc_length}.

% example how light curves change :

Note : at each iteration, longer light curves are not a mere shifted copy of the base 40-year length light curve, but new realizations of the DRW process with the same $\tau$, $\sigma$, $N$, and different baseline.}

\caption{Distribution of Celerite fit results for 1000 iterations of DRW light curve simulations in controlled baseline experiment.  We fix input parameters $\tau$, $\sigma$, and $N$ of points,  but at each iteration we simulate four versions of the light curve  : with 40-year baseline, and those longer by a factor $f \in {2,4,8}$. We fit each baseline version with flat prior or Johnson prior. In each panel  on top of histograms of ratios of best-fit results to input value, we display the $rms$, $bias$, and light curve length in years. The histograms are color-coded by light curve baseline : 40 year (black dotted line), 80 year (thick solid blue line), 160 year (dashed magenta line), 320 year (thin solid red line). As we would expect, the longer the baseline, the less is the bias. The rms also decreases with increasing baseline, because results of fit become more centered on a single value.It is worth noting that even for very long baseline (320 years), we do observe nonzero bias.  }
\label{fig:macleod11_15_baseline}
\end{figure}


\section{Experiments with the structure function shape}
We simulated 1000 light curves with $\tau=100$ days, $\sigma=0.2$ mag (so that $SF_{\infty}=0.2828$ mag), baseline of $20 \tau$, random sampling from  a uniform distribution with sampling interval of $\Delta t=5$ days,   homoscedastic error $0.001$ mag, $N=400$ points. We fit them with flat or Johnson prior. Fig.~\ref{fig:sim_lc_400}


% these two figures use Zeljko's light curves, 
% but i've established in the notebooks 
% that my simulation and his are the same ...

Both are offset, and Fig.~\ref{fig:sim_lc_400_marg} shows the marginalized version of that plot. We repeat the same experiment,  increasing the number of points tenfold to show the behavior of the bias. }
\label{fig:sim_lc_400}
\end{figure*} 


\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1.05\columnwidth]{figs/sigma_tau_ratios_marginalized.png}
\caption{The marginalized version of Fig.~\ref{fig:sim_lc_400}. It shows that both with flat prior and Johnson prior,  there is a bias in fitting well-sampled (400 points), long (20 $\tau$), with virtually no error ($\sigma_{phot}=0.001 $ mag). We investigate how this changes with increased number of points on Figs.~\ref{fig:sim_lc_N_pts_flat} and \ref{fig:sim_lc_N_pts_log}}
\label{fig:sim_lc_400_marg}
\end{figure}


We perform a controlled experiments with this light curve setup: keeping  $\tau$, $\sigma$, baseline, error unchanged, we increase the sampling density $\Delta t$ by a factor $f \in {1,2,4,8}$. Thus $\Delta t$, the sampling interval, is changed as set ${5,2.5, 1.25, 0.625} $ days, and correspondingly the number of points N increases as ${400,800,1600,3200}$.  This experiment shows what effect on the Celerite fits has  increasing the sampling density, with negligible phometric error.

As we expect, both bias and rms decrease as a function of sampling density, although even for very generous sampling of $~12$ hrs we still do not have a distribution that is centered on the true value for this baseline. On this plot we used flat prior. }

\caption{Same as Fig.~\ref{fig:sim_lc_N_pts_flat}, but with Johnson prior.}

\end{figure}


To investigate the structure function, we used the base setup of $\tau=100$ days,  $\sigma=0.2$, error = 0.001 mag, length = $20 \tau$, sampling $\Delta t = 5 $ days. For these light curves we considered raw pairs of  $\Delta m_{i,j}, \Delta t_{i,j}$, as well as plotting the robust standard deviation in 200 bins of $\Delta t$. Note that here $\Delta t_{i,j}$ denotes the time difference between $t_{i}$ and $t_{j}$. We find that the stochasticity of light curves prevents from using structure function for a single object, or even an ensemble with less than approximately 10 objects. We illustrate that on a series of Figs.~\ref{fig:sf_1},~\ref{fig:sf_10},~\ref{fig:sf_100} and ~\ref{fig:sf_1000}.

Here we repeat the basic tenets of the experiment performed by Kozłowski+2017. He simulated 100-year long light curves, with cadence $\Delta t= 2 $ days, $\tau = 200 $days, $SF_{\infty} = 0.2$ mag, that were later degraded to the cadences of SDSS S82 or OGLE-III. Various sections of these light curves were used to test the bias caused by length of time series (baseline). 

We simulated as the 'truth'  10 000 light curves with $\tau=575 $ days, $SF_{\infty}=0.2$ mag, baseline of $100 \tau = 57500$ days (157 years, but expressing the light curve length in terms of multiples of the underlying decorrelation timescale is most informative). We chose the cadence of $\Delta t=1$ day, at regular intervals.

We illustrate the sampling procedure (in other words, the grid of $\rho$), on Fig.~\ref{fig:sampling}

\caption{We illustrate the process of selecting different sections of a light curve, depending on the desired number of points N, and length of section : $\rho$.  From left to right, we sample $N \in {1000,200,60}$ points. Focusing on a single column, from top to bottom we sample on a logarithmic grid of $\rho$. The smallest $\rho$ is set by the maximum attainable light curve section, which corresponds to the full length $l = 100 \tau$, and since $\rho = 1 / l$, $\rho_{min} = 0.01$. The largest $\rho$ is related to the shortest possible light curve section conditional on the number of points chosen. Thus choosing $N \in {1000,200,60}$ days, the shortest possible sections are $l \in {1000,200,60}$ days given that we have adopted the $\Delta t = 1 $ day in 'true' light curve.}

\section{Conclusions}
% or,  have we answered the questions posed initially ?  

We can confirm results of Kozlowski+2017 regarding an inherent biased introduced in fitting the DRW process. We find that even without any prior (flat prior), the results can be reproduced - the $\rho_{out}$ is biased low for light curves shorter than $\approx 10 \tau$.  However,  the bias is not large for light curves even of length only twice the input characteristic time scale. We argue that it is necessary to quantify the 'bias' and 'goodness' of  theoretically possible performance of  fitting the DRW process with available software. Our choice of software - Celerite - did not introduce any significant bias as compared to the tools used by Kozlowski+2017 (since the internal workings of Celerite are similar to Press-Rybicki-Hewitt method - the reason that Celerite is fast is the same that afforded the PRH method to be so quick). Indeed, the shape of likelihood used with Celerite, that better constrains $\hat{\sigma}$ than $\tau$ or $\sigma$  individually, matches the shape of likelihood in Kozlowski (PRH) method.  We propose the measure of percentage departure from the 'truth' as the measure for the goodness of fit,  and we choose  to consider results within $10 \%$ of the true input value of $\tau$ to be 'good'. 

However,  given that $\hat{\sigma}$ may be better constrained than $\tau$ purely due to the likelihood shape,  we suggest that perhaps even for light curves that are too short to estimate 'well' the input timescale, we are able to estimate the asymptotic structure function value. This helps to select quasars from Stars, since even if the timescale cannot be well estimated,  the amplitude of structure function ( driven by $\sigma$) ,  can help distinguish quasars from background noise, since their amplitude of variation is larger. 

We argue that DRW fitting , and recovering the amplitude of variability within the damped random walk model, can help distinguish  quasar light curves from background noise (or noisy stellar measurements) better than other statistical measures (such as chi2 per degree of freedom, standard deviation,  or rms of the light curve).  

To show that ,  we  simulated  DRW light curves in range of tau, and range of sigma.  With the same sampling, we also simulated white noise, that would be reproducing the  noisy measurements (is there any better model for random noise of measurement  for SDSS  or LSST  ? ). For each light curve, fitted with Celerite with DRW model,  we recover $\tau$ and $\sigma$.  We also calculate $\mathcal{P}$ parameters : $\chi^{2}_{DOF}$, $\chi^{2}_{R}$, standard deviation,  rms.  For each set of input tau, sigma,  we have $N$ realizations, and for each $i-th$ realization there are parameters  $\mathcal{P}_{i}$ . We plot a histogram of $\mathcal{P}$ for each value of input $\tau$, $\sigma$. We record the mean and median averaged over many realizations. We plot that as  a two-dimensional histogram as  $\log{(\rho_{in})}$  vs each parameter $\mathcal{P}$, overplotting the mean and median (along y-axis).
